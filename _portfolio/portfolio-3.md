title: "Mobility Analysis using Call Detail Records and Location Data"
excerpt: "This project involved analyzing user mobility patterns using a large dataset of call detail records (CDRs) and location data. Key steps included preprocessing over 19,000 files, sampling 1.5 million unique users, generating summary statistics, and exploring the relationship between average unique locations and the radius of gyration. Using PySpark for scalable data processing, along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization, the project provided insights into how users move based on telecom data. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
